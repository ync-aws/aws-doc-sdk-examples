# Multi-Language Integration Test Runner
This directory contains the source and infrastructure code for running multi-language integration tests in AWS.

## Problem & solution statement
This repository contains example code written in [11 of the AWS-supported Software Development Kit (SDK) languages](../README.md#how-this-repository-is-organized). 
This code must be tested to ensure its accuracy and functionality over time. 
However, while this repository contains comprehensive test coverage, each test must be manually-triggered and can take many hours to complete.

This solution offers centralized triggering and language-agnostic test orchestration. In exchange, it requires ["automation-friendly" tests]() and the deployment of the below CDK stacks.

## Design features
The following design features make this tool easy to use:
* **Serverless**. Requires no stateful infrastructure
* **No pipeline**. Relies on events, not manual interaction.
* **All code**. The entire solution is deployable via CDK.

## Architecture
In addition to the source code in this repository, this solution consists of the following CDK stacks:

| Stack                                                | Function                                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Public Images](./public_ecr_repositories)     | Holds versions of language-specialized Docker images.             | Event-based production of ready-to-run Docker images for each [supported SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/version-support-matrix.html) |
| [Producer](./eventbridge_rule_with_sns_fanout) | Publishes a scheduled message to an SNS topic.                    | Centralized cron-based triggering of integration tests.                                                                                                    |
| [Consumer](./sqs_lambda_to_batch_fargate)      | Consumes a message to trigger integration tests on Batch Fargate. | Federated integration testing of example code for each [supported SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/version-support-matrix.html).       |

## How it works
On the surface, this solution orchestrates the execution of distributed integration testing for the 11 [supported SDK's](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/version-support-matrix.html).
Under the hood, it relies on the source code in this repository and the CDK stacks listed below.

### 1. Image production
Image repositories are managed from an AWS account in which the [Public images stack]() is deployed.

Through a secure integration, a GitHub Workflow [configured in this repository](../.github/workflows/docker-push.yml) produces Docker images containing pre-built SDK code and publishes them to the [AWS SDK Code Examples Images](https://gallery.ecr.aws/b4v4v1s0) public registry.

See [CDK stack](./public_ecr_repositories).

### 2. Centralized eventing
Events are emitted from an AWS account in which the [Producer Stack](./eventbridge_rule_with_sns_fanout) is deployed.

This stack contains a cron-based EventBridge rule that writes to a singular SNS topic. 
Through a cross-account integration, SQS queues in different AWS accounts can subscribe to this topic.

See [CDK stack](./eventbridge_rule_with_sns_fanout).

### 3. Distributed testing
Testing is performed in AWS accounts in which the [Consumer Stack](./sqs_lambda_to_batch_fargate) is deployed.

This stack contains a Lambda function that submits jobs to AWS Batch. 
Through a secure integration, this Lambda function is triggered via a SQS queue subscribed to a cross-account topic.

See [CDK stack](./sqs_lambda_to_batch_fargate).
